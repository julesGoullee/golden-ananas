### Introduction:

Within a week and our knowledge in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org) ecosystem we define our target: build a proof of concept of the game play.  
We keep in mind our experience playing the scene a few months ago during the public launch, rules are not clear, what I have to do now?  
I spend so much time on this scene not because it's difficult, or the gameplay is challenging, just because I don't understand what to do.  
So we arrive at the conclusion: let's proof we can build an easy to understand, with a game flow chained perfectly in decentraland:  
simple, small, beautiful.

### Concept:

Platform arcade running game, if you failed you have to restart the whole level.  
Make the best score for each level and get into the competition to be the first at the global leader board.  
Each level done changes the scene radically, and progress in the whole history.  
Every (Juicy) 3D models, images, logo are homemade by [@ninja-fire](https://github.com/ninja-fire). Our (messy) moodboard in [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/file/kkYNHc3aGHDSNXKWw6peBi/goldananas?node-id=1%3A2)  
The game is backed by a dedicated set of Ethereum smart contracts, fully decentralised backend.

Save each user progression and score, maintain leaderboard top ranks, mint trophies when a player finishes a level as an NFT ERC721, make a donation to support us.  
Progression can be saved at the end of each level, the user can refuse and batch seamlessly many levels resulting in one Ethereum transaction.  
When you come back on the scene it will automatically load the level to continue where you stopped.

### Next steps:

We decide to make something fine-tuned, well packaged in place or building much more stuff.  
As independent creative persons, we need funding in order to continue to work on this project.  
We deeply integrate this in our game, you will see at the end of the game (what is done so for).  
We integrate a fundraising to paid of a missing glass in order to continue the history of the game.
In practice, it will fund the project to help us buy new parcels to continue this awesome adventure.  
We fix a cap that will allow us to accomplish that.  
We plan to distribute for each contributor a collectible that represents the missing glass.

##### To do:
	
When all levels are done, allow the player to re-play any levels to increase his score in the lead board!
We put down different gameplay block, let's combine then to build much more complex level.

### Let's try it:

Play in standalone on Ethereum ropsten testnet: [https://golden-ananas.vercel.app](https://golden-ananas.vercel.app?DEBUG&ENABLE_WEB3&SCENE_DEBUG_PANEL&position=-13%2C-121&realm=localhost-stub)  
Note: sadly at the date of 7/08/20 the decentraland export sdk have an issue with the metamask connection.  
If you want to test the blockchain integration you have to pull this repo, and run the dev server on your localhost. (witch  your metamask account to ropsten network).  
Open in your browser: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/?DEBUG&ENABLE_WEB3&SCENE_DEBUG_PANEL&position=-13%2C-121&realm=localhost-stub](http://127.0.0.1:8000/?DEBUG&ENABLE_WEB3&SCENE_DEBUG_PANEL&position=-13%2C-121&realm=localhost-stub)
